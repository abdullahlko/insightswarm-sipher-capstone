# Unified InsightSwarm Frontend Plan

## What We're Building

A static landing page at `frontend/landing/` that acts as the entry point to the entire InsightSwarm ecosystem — two claymorphism-styled cards linking out to the React workspace and the Streamlit dashboard.

    style C fill:#533483,stroke:#2b2d42,color:#eee
    style D fill:#0a3d62,stroke:#0a3d62,color:#eee
```

Three separate apps, three separate ports during development. The landing page simply opens the other two in new tabs.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Landing Portal — `frontend/landing/` (You build this)

A zero-dependency static site with claymorphism design. Separate folders per your preference:

```
frontend/landing/
├── index.html          ← Semantic HTML, SEO meta, Google Fonts (Inter + Space Grotesk)
├── css/
│   └── styles.css      ← Full claymorphism design system
├── js/
│   └── script.js       ← Tilt effect, scroll reveals, URL config
└── package.json        ← Vite only, dev server on :3000
```

**Design direction — Claymorphism on dark:**
- Deep navy base (`#0d0d1a` → `#13132b`)
- Cards with multi-layered shadows: outer depth + inner highlights for the soft 3D clay feel
- Floating gradient blobs in background, subtle noise texture
- Two large cards with SVG icons, status badges ("Production" / "Developer"), and animated CTA buttons
- Hover: 3D mouse-tracking tilt + shadow intensification
- Entrance: staggered fade-up on load
- Responsive: 2-column grid → stacked on mobile
- Minimal comments, natural coding style

**Card 1** — "Launch InsightSwarm Workspace" → opens `localhost:5173`
**Card 2** — "Open Developer Control Center" → opens `localhost:8501`

### 2. React+Tailwind Sub-Team Spec (2 members)

The React app at `frontend/React+Tailwind/` is the **InsightSwarm Workspace** — the user-facing research client.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Vite config is currently missing `@vitejs/plugin-react`. The team needs to add it or JSX won't compile properly.

**Features to build:**

| Feature | API Endpoint | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Research Submission Form | `POST /api/research` | P0 |
| Live Status Polling | `GET /api/research/{run_id}` | P0 |
| Report Viewer (markdown) | `GET /api/research/{run_id}/report` | P1 |
| PDF Download Button | `GET /api/research/{run_id}/download` | P1 |
| Research History List | `GET /api/research/{run_id}` (multiple) | P2 |

**Packages to add:** `react-router-dom`, `axios`, `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`, `framer-motion`

**Recommended folder structure:**
```
src/
├── components/       ← Button, Card, StatusBadge, Navbar
├── pages/            ← SubmitPage, StatusPage, ReportPage
├── services/         ← researchApi.js (axios instance, base URL config)
├── hooks/            ← useResearchStatus, useReport (polling logic)
├── App.jsx           ← Router + layout
├── main.jsx          ← Entry
└── index.css         ← Tailwind imports + custom tokens
```

CORS is already configured in [main.py](file:///e:/InsightSwarm/app/main.py) for `localhost:5173`.

---

### 3. Streamlit Sub-Team Spec (2 members)

The Streamlit app at `frontend/streamlit/` is the **Developer Control Center** — a diagnostic dashboard.

**Features to build:**

| Feature | API Endpoint | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| System Health Panel | `GET /health` | P0 |
| Research Run Monitor | `GET /api/research/{run_id}` | P0 |
| Run Inspector (drill-in) | `GET /api/research/{run_id}/report` | P1 |
| Report Preview (markdown) | `GET /api/research/{run_id}/report` | P1 |
| Log Viewer | Local file reads or future endpoint | P2 |

**Recommended file structure:**
```
streamlit/
├── streamlit-app.py          ← Main entry with page nav
├── pages/
│   ├── 1_🏠_Dashboard.py
│   ├── 2_🔍_Run_Inspector.py
│   └── 3_📄_Report_Viewer.py
├── components/
│   └── api_client.py          ← requests wrapper for FastAPI
└── .streamlit/
    └── config.toml            ← Dark theme matching landing page palette
```

**Theme config** (`.streamlit/config.toml`):
```toml
[theme]
primaryColor = "#e94560"
backgroundColor = "#0F2027"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#203A43"
textColor = "#EAEAEA"
font = "sans serif"
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Streamlit team will need CORS added for `localhost:8501` in [main.py](file:///e:/InsightSwarm/app/main.py) if they call the FastAPI backend directly. Currently only `:5173` is whitelisted.

## Git Branch Strategy

| Branch | Owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend/landing-portal` | You | Landing page |
| `frontend/react-workspace` | React sub-team | Full React client |
| `frontend/streamlit-dashboard` | Streamlit sub-team | Streamlit control center |

All merge to `main` via PR per your existing [README](file:///e:/InsightSwarm/README.md) workflow.

## Open Questions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Should I build the landing portal now?** I can create it immediately with claymorphism, separate folders, and minimal comments — ready for you to review.
